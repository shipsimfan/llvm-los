#Simple Build Instructions

On a UNIX-like machine, run the following commands from the cloned repository to build LLVM for LOS:
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;lld" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/usr/local" -G "Ninja" ../llvm
cmake --build .
cmake --build . --target install
```

You may replace "Ninja" with "Unix Makefiles" if you prefer to use Make over Ninja. Ninja is preferred to Make because it is both quicker and uses less memory.
You may also replace the install prefix with any prefered location to install clang, just be sure that it is available on your PATH.

If the build fails midway due to running out of memory, just re-running the build command allows it to continue. This may happen multiple times.
Ninja uses less memory than Make if your are encountering running out of memory while using Make.
